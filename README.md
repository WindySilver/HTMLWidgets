# HTMLWidgets
My HTML widgets I use for displaying data (mostly statistics) on my website.
Since WordPress isn't a fan of the way I format these widgets, I've had to post the widgets there and on DeviantArt (which used to be my main platform) as pictures. Therefore, the actual raw HTML is here to see for anyone who wants to see what makes them tick.

If you want to use these widgets, I recommend taking the Template versions since they have the data erased for clarity.
